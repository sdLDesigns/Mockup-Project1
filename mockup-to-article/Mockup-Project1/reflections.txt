The most important skill I've learned so far is to seek information, and to ask for help. Nothing has been too easy but, conversely nothing has been too hard. If I'm being honest the most difficult part so far is remembering the HTML elements and the syntax. I used the trial and error method of getting through this first project. I learned by testing and then correcting things I knew I could make better.
